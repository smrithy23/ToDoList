# ToDoList
The goal of the project is create a user-friendly application to allow users to keep track of their day-to-day tasks. 

## Users can do the following to manage their tasks:
* Add tasks
* Mark tasks as completed
* Deleted tasks
* Edit task description
* Sort the tasks from high to low priority
* Save the list to a text file for future purposes
* Load the list from a exisiting file to continue working on the list

A database was created to keep track of the tasks using MySQL.

## To run this application
1. Open helper.py
2. Go to run menu and click run

## Things not implemented
* Delete query does not work for deleting the task from the table
* Tkinter was not use for UI - needs to be implemented
* Allow users to add due dates to the task
